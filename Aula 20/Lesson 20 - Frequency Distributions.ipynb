We collect data to analyze it, and we analyze it for different purposes:\n","\n","- To describe phenomena in the world (science).\n","- To make better decisions (industries).\n","- To improve systems (engineering).\n","- To describe different aspects of our society (data journalism); etc.\n","\n","<center><img width=\"250\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1_QX1g2KHfZVpg5mVsRUO4CJgp0F5StwP\"></center>\n","\n","\n","Our capacity to understand a data set just by looking at it in a table format is limited, and it decreases dramatically as the size of the data set increases.

This might not seem like much compared to other data sets, but it's still extremely difficult to find any patterns just by eyeballing the data set in a table format.

Because 33 of the players are forwards, the frequency for forwards is 33, and so on.\n","\n","With the table above, we simplified the **POS variable** by transforming it to a comprehensible format. Instead of having to deal with analyzing 143 values (the length of the POS variable), now we only have five values to analyze. We can make a few conclusions now that would have been difficult and time consuming to reach at just by looking at the list of 143 values:\n","\n","- We can see how the frequencies are distributed:\n","  - Almost half of the players play as guards.\n","  - Most of the players are either guards, forwards or centers.\n","  - Very few players have combined positions (like guard/forward or forward/center).\n","- We can make comparisons with ease:\n","  - There are roughly two times more guards than forwards.\n","  - There are slightly less centers that forwards; etc.\n","  \n","Because the table above shows how frequencies are distributed, it's often called a **frequency distribution table**, or, shorter, **frequency table** or **frequency distribution**. Throughout this mission, our focus will be on learning the details behind this form of simplifying data.\n","\n","\n","**Exercise**\n","\n","<img width=\"100\"
